## Pet Shop Management System (Paws'n Claws)

### Introduction
The purpose of this project is to build an e-Commerce system for pet shop which is called Paws'n Claws for customer and staff. This project is a group project for two courses in my university which are TU3404 Software Development for Information System and TE3503 Software Testing.
